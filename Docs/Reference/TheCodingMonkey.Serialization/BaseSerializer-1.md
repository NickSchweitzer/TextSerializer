# BaseSerializer&lt;TTargetType&gt; class

Base class that contains common code for all serializers in the library. This class primary handles common reflection and configuration items.

```csharp
public abstract class BaseSerializer<TTargetType>
    where TTargetType : new()
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| TTargetType | The type of object that will be serialized. Either TargetType must have the [`TextSerializable attribute`](TextSerializableAttribute.md) applied, and any fields contained must have the [`TextField attribute`](TextFieldAttribute.md) applied to them, or the Fluent Configuration model must be used. |

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [FieldGapsAllowed](BaseSerializer-1/FieldGapsAllowed.md) { get; set; } | True if there are gaps allowed in the Position order. False if a column can be empty. |
| [Fields](BaseSerializer-1/Fields.md) { get; } | Dictionary of Fields which have been configured for this Serializer. The Key is the Position, and the Value is the Field definition class. |
| [TargetType](BaseSerializer-1/TargetType.md) { get; } | The type which will be created for each record in the file. |

## Protected Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [BaseSerializer](BaseSerializer-1/BaseSerializer.md)(…) | Default constructor for the base type. Does only basic initialization of the TargetType. |
| abstract [GetFieldFromAttribute](BaseSerializer-1/GetFieldFromAttribute.md)(…) | Used by a derived class to return a Field configuration specific to this serializer back for a given method based on the attributes applied. |
| [InitializeFromAttributes](BaseSerializer-1/InitializeFromAttributes.md)() | Initializes the field definitions for this class using Attributes, which occurs if a Fluent Configuration is not passed into the Constructor. |
| static [AssignToClass](BaseSerializer-1/AssignToClass.md)(…) | Helper function which uses reflection to assign a given value to a member if a class is involved. |
| static [AssignToStruct](BaseSerializer-1/AssignToStruct.md)(…) | Helper function which uses reflection to assign a given value to a member if a struct is involved. |
